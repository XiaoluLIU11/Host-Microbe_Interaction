Analytical R codes for Host-Microbe_Interaction

## Abstract
Metabolic interactions among host cells, pathogens and active compounds are fundamental to the personal care industry, yet current methods for mechanism-based assessment are usually slow, tedious, and costly. Here, we established a host-microbe-active interaction model which consists of HGE cells, Porphyromonas gingivalis or Streptococcus sanguinis, and stannous fluoride (SnF2). Applying single-cell Raman spectroscopy, we identified a hemin biomarker for P. gingivalis invasion in HGE cells and created a Ramanomic Index of Metabolic Stress (RIMS) to measure stress effects and SnF2's relief. Integrated analyses of ramanome, transcriptome, and metabolome confirmed that SnF2 mitigates P. gingivalis-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic changes while enhancing nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, showcasing its dual role in combating inflammation and promoting metabolic balance. These multi-omics findings advocated for ramanomics-based metrices such as RIMS as a rapid, cost-effective, and mechanism-based tool for assessing the effects of biotic and abiotic factors in personal care.
